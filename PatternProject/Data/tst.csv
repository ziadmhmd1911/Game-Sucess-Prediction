New Shikigami Hana arrives! Battle map renewed for the first time, along with a brand new skin series to keep you cool during the summer! There's also the Summer Festival event, with lots of bonuses waiting for you to earn!\n\nOnmyoji Arena is part the hit Onmyoji series from NetEase. It builds on the rich character base from the original work to create a new MOBA experience. The game retains the elegant Japanese aesthetics and original voice talents to faithfully recreate Kyoto in the Heian era. With innovative map designs, a Fog of War mode, and an even larger set of Shikigami skills, players are in for more fun and greater challenges as they battle to reign supreme. The paid amulet system is now replaced by a free Onmyodo system. This levels the playing field. Players from all over the world are connected, and the all-new 3v3v3 Battle Royale will provide players with a fun and novel MOBA experience.\n\n\u2014 Beautiful Shikigami with original voice cast to replicate the Heian world with perfection.\nOnmyoji Arena retains the elegant Japanese aesthetics from Onmyoji as well as its stellar Japanese voice cast to give players a more authentic gaming experience.

Prove your strategic prowess on the battlefield now!\nOnmyoji Arena does away with the amulet system, and all players can now create their own combinations of Onmyoji's abilities (Onmyodo) for free. Based on their strategy, players can freely mix and match the abilities in Onmyoji, adding another variable to the game. Moreover, there is no paid system that affects combat stats. Now all is truly fair in battle and lore!\n\n\n\u2014 Balance of power. Tons of skills. Battle to your heart's content!\nOnmyoji Arena carefully evens out the distribution of power in the game, so that each Shikigami is equally strong yet possesses unique charm. Now there's a useful role for everyone. Shikigami have 4 abilities and 2 general spells, allowing for more combinations of abilities and tactics. Unique ability sets bring about greater possibilities. Innovative map designs and the Fog of War system make strategy even more critical, so that players can fully experience this new mobile MOBA. At the same time, the game is revolutionary in that it connects top players from all over the world to test their might.\n\n\n\u2014 Innovative Battle Royale for a three-party showdown\nThe first ever 3v3v3 battle mode, Battle Royale, incorporates new features like multi-team battles, competition for resources, and fast-paced combat. Players are divided into 3 teams of 3 for an exciting new multi-team experience! In the Battle Royale mode, players will spawn from three locations on the map with the combat zone located in the center. The first team to seal 30 Shikigami shall reign supreme!""",NetEase Games,12+,"EN, JA, KO, ZH, ZH",2212520960,Games,,3/8/2018,23/07/2019
